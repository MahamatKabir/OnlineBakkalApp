# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/images/
     - assets/images/png-clipart-truck-truck.png
     - assets/images/offres/Offer1.jpg
     - assets/images/offres/Offer2.jpg
     - assets/images/offres/Offer3.jpg
     - assets/images/offres/Offer4.jpg
     - assets/images/cat/fruits.png
     - assets/images/cat/veg.png
     - assets/images/cat/Spinach.png
     - assets/images/cat/nuts.png
     - assets/images/cat/spices.png
     - assets/images/cat/grains.png
     - assets/images/landing/buyfood.jpg
     - assets/images/logo.png
     - assets/images/grocery.png
      
     
     

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
